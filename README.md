# About

IVFi-PHP is a file directory browser script made in PHP and TypeScript.

It is designed to be a comprehensive indexer, with a focus on efficiently handling image and video files. IVFi has a modern and user-friendly interface, offering features such as a gallery view, hoverable previews, and many customization options.

This project can be easily set up on most web servers.

<br/>

# Quick setup :zap:

* Download the latest release [here](https://github.com/sixem/ivfi-php/releases).
* Place the `/build/` files into your web root. For example `/var/www/html/`.
* Then, use the `indexer.php` as an index file for any of the directories where the script should be used:

#### Nginx - Example using the [index](https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_index_module.html#index) directive:
```
server {
        index index.html index.php /indexer.php;
}
```

#### Apache - Example using the [DirectoryIndex](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/mod/mod_dir.html#directoryindex) directive:
```
DirectoryIndex index.html index.php /indexer.php
```

<br/>

For detailed instructions on how to configure the script, refer to [setup](https://git.five.sh/ivfi/docs/php/#/setup).

The releases and individual builds are available [here](https://git.five.sh/ivfi/releases/php/).
